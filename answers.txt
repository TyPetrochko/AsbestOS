The processor starts executing in 32-bit mode when it sets the protected mode enable flag at line 107 of boot1.S. 

The following snippet loads the global descriptor table (GDT) descriptor into the GDT, sets the protected flag, and then, since the program is now in 32-bit mode, makes a long jump (cross-segment) to a section responsible for calling the C functions.

	lgdt		gdtdesc
	movl		%cr0, %eax
	orl		$CR0_PE_ON, %eax	# flag is enabled on this line
	movl		%eax, %cr0
	ljmp		$PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg
