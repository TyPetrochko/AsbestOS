1) Should exception/interrupt handlers return a value? Right now they are not executing logic.

Fork pseudocode:

TSyscall.sys_fork()
  - do get_curid()
  - figure out current id's quota, and figure out half quota
  - do thread_spawn(current id's eip reg, current id, half_quota)
    -> will spawn a new stack, make a new tcb, enqueue it, yadda yadda yadda
  
  - set all pages
